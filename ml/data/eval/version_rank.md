| 3 | 0.0 | Latin | Model refused to generate content, citing 'offensive language' concern. Preamble flag for meta-framing refusal message. |
| 32 | 5.3 | Country | Uses editorial (country superstar, album six, pre-add), song description (Sleepless in a Hotel Room, 13th track, The Way I Am, January 7 2026, loneliness).

| 14 | 8.3 | Hip-Hop/Rap | Misattributed: calls 'Body' a track by Don Toliver, but TrackDescription says it's 'the second track from OCTANE transitioning from E85'. Also hallucinated 'sixth album' — ArtistBio says OCTANE is his fifth album. Confused identity. |
| 19 | 8.3 | J-Pop | Opens with 'Here is…' (preamble). Hallucinated 'Jane Doe' as a person — TrackDescription says 'JANE DOE' is a song title, not a vocalist. Misattributed Utada Hikaru as 'Jane Doe'. Confused identity. |
