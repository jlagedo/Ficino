# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Ficino

A macOS menu bar app that listens to Apple Music track changes and delivers AI-powered commentary via Apple Intelligence. Runs as a menu bar utility (LSUIElement=true, no dock icon). Zero external dependencies — pure Apple frameworks.

## Build & Run

Open `Ficino.xcodeproj` in Xcode, or build from CLI:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Ficino.xcodeproj -scheme Ficino -derivedDataPath ./build build
```

Build output: `./build/Build/Products/Debug/Ficino.app`

There's a second scheme **MusicContextGenerator** for the metadata testing tool:
```sh
xcodebuild -project Ficino.xcodeproj -scheme MusicContextGenerator -derivedDataPath ./build build
```

**Requirements:** macOS 26+, Apple Music.

**No test suite exists.** Testing is manual via build and run.

## Architecture

**Pattern:** MVVM with a single `AppState` observable object coordinating services. Views bind to `@StateObject AppState`.

**Source layout:**
- `Ficino/Models/` — Data types and state (`AppState`, `TrackInfo`, `Personality`, `CommentEntry`)
- `Ficino/Services/` — Business logic (`MusicListener`, `AppleIntelligenceService`, `ArtworkService`, `NotificationService`, `CommentaryService`)
- `Ficino/Views/` — SwiftUI components (`MenuBarView`, `NowPlayingView`, `HistoryView`, `SettingsView`)
- `MusicContext/` — Swift package for fetching music metadata from MusicBrainz and MusicKit APIs
- `MusicContextGenerator/` — Standalone macOS app for testing MusicContext providers (GUI + CLI mode)

**Key flow:** MusicListener detects track change via `DistributedNotificationCenter` → `AppState.handleTrackChange()` → parallel artwork fetch + commentary request (`async let`) → result saved to history → floating NSPanel notification shown → every 5 songs triggers a review.

### Services

**AppleIntelligenceService** uses the `FoundationModels` framework (macOS 26+) to generate commentary. It conforms to `CommentaryService`, the protocol boundary for the AI backend.

**Notifications** are custom floating `NSPanel` windows (not system UNUserNotificationCenter), hosted with SwiftUI content and auto-dismissed after a configurable duration. This avoids system permission prompts and gives full control over styling/positioning.

### MusicContext Package

`MusicContext/` is a standalone Swift package with two providers:

- **MusicBrainzProvider** — Actor wrapping MusicBrainz REST API with rate limiting (1 req/sec). Has a multi-fallback search strategy: strips Apple Music suffixes (" - EP", " (Deluxe)"), featuring credits, collaborator names to improve match rates. Multi-stage lookup: recording → tags/genres → artist details → release group → label/format.
- **MusicKitProvider** — Actor wrapping Apple MusicKit catalog search with smart matching (exact → fuzzy → fallback). Loads full relationships (albums, artists, composers, genres, audio variants).

**MusicContextGenerator** can run as GUI or CLI with arguments: `-p mb|mk <Artist> <Album> <Track> [DurationMs]` or `-p mk --id <CatalogID>`.

## Xcode Project Rules

- **NEVER modify `.pbxproj` or any file inside `.xcodeproj`** — one corrupted project file wastes hours. The project uses Xcode 16+ synchronized folders (`PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`), so creating/editing/deleting Swift files on disk is automatically picked up by Xcode.
- For structural changes (new targets, build settings, frameworks, build phases), instruct the user to do it manually in Xcode.

## Important Details

- App sandbox is **disabled** in `Ficino.entitlements` — needed for DistributedNotificationCenter and AppleScript execution
- `FicinoApp.swift` is the `@main` entry using `MenuBarExtra` scene API
- Album artwork is fetched via AppleScript bridge to Music.app (`raw data of artwork 1 of current track`), not MusicKit
- History is capped at 50 entries with JPEG-compressed thumbnails (48pt, 0.7 quality)
- Single personality ("Ficino") with a detailed system prompt defined in `Personality.swift`
- **Preferences** persist via `UserDefaults`: skip threshold, notification duration
- Skip threshold enforcement: only generates commentary for tracks played longer than the threshold, preventing spam from rapid skipping
- All services use **actor isolation** for thread safety (AppleIntelligenceService, MusicBrainzProvider, MusicKitProvider, RateLimiter)
- `AppState` and `NotificationService` are `@MainActor`-isolated for UI safety
